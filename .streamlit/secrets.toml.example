# Coolify/Streamlit secrets mapping
#
# In Coolify, set environment variables with the same names as below (all caps, underscores):
#   DB_DEV_URL, DB_LEAD_URL, GITLAB_URL, CORPUS_URL, DB_API, GITLAB_API, CORPUS_API
#
# Streamlit will read these from the environment if not found in secrets.toml
#
# Example Coolify environment variables:
#   DB_DEV_URL=...
#   DB_LEAD_URL=...
#   GITLAB_URL=...
#   CORPUS_URL=...
#   DB_API=...
#   GITLAB_API=...
#   CORPUS_API=...
#
# You can also keep this file for local development.

# If running on Coolify, these values will be loaded from environment variables automatically.
# For local development, you can set them here or in your .streamlit/secrets.toml file.

# Example secrets - replace these with your actual secrets in secrets.toml
